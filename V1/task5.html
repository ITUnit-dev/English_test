            <b>Spirit</b> - 1) дух; 2) личность; 3) характер<br><br>

            13.To study the art of leadership we are to begin with its most important el-ement: character. 14.A good
            leader leads by example. 15.How a leader acts is more important than how he thinks or what he says.
            <br>16.A warrior is someone whose strong character enables them to make sacri-fices for the team and achieve
            their goals. 17.Warriors defend something valuable - their personal honor. 18.It means that a person makes a
            promise to himself that he will not lie, cheat, or steal, even if somebody does those wrongs. 19.That person
            has a warrior spirit.

            <br>Good Reputation. 29.People who display a warrior spirit build good Reputa-tions. 30.A good reputation
            opens doors that are closed to people whose sense of honor is doubtful.

            the team. 33.They remind people of their duty and in-spire them to live up to the highest standards of
